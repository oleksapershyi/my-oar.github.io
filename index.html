				I have the goal!
			</p>
			<p class="text-dark">
				I leave the right to myself not to reveal it, but its existence fulfills the sense of my human being. Perceive it as an abstract notion.
			</p>
			<p class="text-dark">
				One of the stages of my goal achievement, according to my reality, is becoming an 'oarsman', a 'galley slave' or simply a developer with the future professional growth.
			</p>
			<p class="text-dark">
				Everything is quiet simple! If you want to become an 'oarsman', learn how to row. Row every day, according to the principle CSG (constantly, sustainable, gradually).
			</p>
			<p class="text-dark">
				Before I started attending ITA, my goal was quite blurry and frankly speaking I didn't have the vision of its realization. It would not be right, if I say that I now have the 100% vision of its realization vector, but, I have clearly formed the direction and faith in that what I can and what I'm up to! Yes, I realize that my way to the goal using 'oar' cold be longer than I'm expecting. But I try to perceive it as the normal working process.
			</p>
			<p class="text-dark">
				As I see, my way to profession may be connected with such technologies as: JavaScript (HTML, CSS), Node.js, Ruby e.t.c. The specialization I would like to get is Frontend. You can wonder why, can’t you?
			</p>
			<p class="text-dark">
				The latest project with HTML/CSS/JS I have made, enhanced my confidence and I realized that I am gradually getting satisfaction from the instant results of my work and the entire development process, especially when I trap into the flow. Being in this physical and mental state of light obsession and total concentration, filled with ideas, when you clearly realize and know what exactly the solution is,  where and how it should be implemented, all these moments of extra productivity are really inspiring for me.
			</p>
			<p class="text-dark">
				Summarizing 5 months of studying at ITA, I can draw the following conclusions:
			</p>
			<ul class="text-dark">
				<li class="text-dark">Everything differs from what I’ve imagined...</li>
				<li class="text-dark">I have oatmeal brain. Sometimes everything’s clear and the puzzle is set up.</li>
				<li class="text-dark">Lenin knew something, saying:  "Study, study, study"...</li>
				<li class="text-dark">If you want to learn how to row, you should row. No one was born as an oarsman.</li>
				<li class="text-dark">That is awesome when you are surrounded by the experienced 'oarsmen' and your readiness allows you to perceive and absorb their expertise. </li>
				<li class="text-dark">You are stronger when you are a part of a team!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
				<li class="text-dark">Studying at ITA is just the first  stage, the start, though it’s the most important stage.</li>
				<li class="text-dark">There is a huge amount of information to be learned ahead.</li>
				<li class="text-dark">This is a long-term project, but the work's value should be estimated. </li>
			</ul>
			<p class="text-dark pb-5">
				These conclusions inspire me, because this is a work for years, every time I should learn something new. It would be a lot of fun!
			</p>
			<p class="text-dark pb-5">
				P.S. Near, will be some encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism and abstraction instead of cherry on the cake. Inspired by Oleksii Tyurenkov. Scroll down, if you want ;)
